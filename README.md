#Data Archetypes
  
>**Data should be able to flow fast and freely between multiple applications...**  
>To achieve this, we need standard formats for common types of data.  If data does not change shape, it's easier for developers to build applications that work with it, plus it's easier for users to adopt those applications, and increase productivity of their data.


####Standards for common types of data formatted in JSON Schemas

** Servant (http://servant.co) hosts these Data Archetypes in the cloud on behalf of users and splits its hosting revenue with developers who build applications that use with these Data Archetypes.
